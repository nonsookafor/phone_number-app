This is a design made up of the numbers from zero to nine, a restart and a delete button. There is also a total that displays the numbers that have been chosen. As these numbers are chosen, they are immediately transformed to the optimal phone number structure. When the button representing a number is clicked, the number is added to the total. Once it is time for a hyphen that seperates the different parts of a phone number, the hyphen is displayed. The delete button deletes the previous number that was added to total and the restart button deletes all the numbers that have been added to total making total an empty string.
